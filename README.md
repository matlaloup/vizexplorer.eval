# Java Developer Programming Challenge
A set of Java coding tasks to assess Java programming and design skills. This document outlines how to build and use the application and what is required for the challenge.

## Overview of the Challenge
The following is a simple Java project which does very little. The Person class can be instantiated and populated but is not properly displayed and immediately lost.

## Build
To build the application, execute a standard maven build on the HEAD of the master branch. This will produce a jar file in the target folder.

### Usage
The application has a simple command line interface which is run using a java -jar command on the jar file produced in the build step above. It is completely undocumented, to discover how it is used you must examine the code in main().

## Goals (Submit fixes to your forked copy of the repository)
When finished you should have a fork of the github repo which contains 4 separate branches or pull request, each containing your solution to one of the issues.

* Resolve all of the four (4) open issues. Fix each in a separate commit or branch (or pull request).
* Each commit must be based on the same (initial) version of the code as at the HEAD of master, such that they can be evaluated independently of one another.
* Optional: Make improvements to the existing code not covered in any issue. There are areas of the code that may have bugs or could be improved by refactoring. Submit pull requests with descriptions that describe the problem and your solution.

## Constraints
* It is expected that the tasks can be completed within a couple of hours but the solution must be submitted within 24 hours after starting the challenge.
* Observe the coding conventions in the legacy code and maintain consistent coding style in any code you submit.
* It is possible to pass without completing every task, so committing in order of the milestones defined in the project is advisable.

# Instructions
These are basic step by step instructions to get you started.

The project has a number of known issues some bugs and many other non-functional issues with respect to robustness, maintenance and usability which could be improved. You may suggest improvements or create issues that describe an enhancement and implement the solution.

If at any point you are unclear make a judgement call and if necessary describe it in comments or a wiki page in your copy of the repository on GitHub. It is not expected that this challenge should take longer than a couple of hours total so simple solutions are expected as long as they meet the requirements of the issues.

## Fork the GitHub Repository
Create a fork into your own GitHub account to do the work (Sign up a new accout at GitHub.com if needed). When you are finished, please share the link with us so we can see how you solved the problem.

## Commit Changes Corresponding to Each Issue To Your copy of the repo
For each of the issues being resolved, modify code in the master branch and commit changes to a branch named after for that issue and push.

## Forward us a link.
Send us a link to your git repository containing all branches and/or pull requests for each of the solutions.
